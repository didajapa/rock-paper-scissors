1. Create function `getComputerChoice`, this function returns 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors'
2. Create variable `playerSelection`. Case-insensitive
    - use `prompt` to get input from the user
    
3. Write function `playRound` that plays single round of Rock Paper Scissors. Parameters for this function:
    - `playerSelection`
    - `computerSelection`
    
4. Return a string that declares the winner (such as *"You lose! Paper beats Rock"*)
5. `return` the result, *not* `console.log()`
6. Write new function `game()`. Call `playRound` inside this on to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
    - use `for` loop to play those five rounds
    - use `console.log` to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.
